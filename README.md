# Emotion_detection
This notebook documents my own investigation on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for emotion detection.  Each model was constructed from the ground up, without the use of pre-trained architectures, in order to improve my comprehension of activation behavior and feature learning.

 Important observations: 
 In order to enhance generalization, I used sophisticated data augmentation and iteratively adjusted the CNN architecture.
 To visually evaluate the model's attention and confirm that it is focused on the appropriate face regions, I used Grad-CAM.
